/**
 * An independent part of the app and/or UI that is capable of rendering itself to HTML by implementing the [render] method.
 * A component can also load data, perform calculations etc in [create] and perform various tasks after rendering via [postRender].
 * Each component must also be given a destination Element ID [dstId] as a constructor parameter - the component
 * is painted inside the Element with the given ID, overwriting previous contents.
 * The destination element must exist in the DOM before this component is painted.
 * A component can have children components that are automatically created and built when [createAndBuild]ing this component
 * and rebuilt when [rebuild]ing this component.
 * [parent] is this component's parent component in the component tree, should be null if this is the root component.
 *
 * Call [createAndBuild] to create and build this component and its children.
 * Call [rebuild] to rebuild this component and its children (if its state has changed).
 *
 * Components should not directly call any methods other than [createAndBuild] and [rebuild] on themselves.
